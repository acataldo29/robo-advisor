# Robo Advisor Application

This application will provide clients with recommendations to their portfolio. Mainly, this app will allow users to input a stock's or cryptocurreny's symbols and provide some statistics for that stock along with a recommendation of whether or not to buy.

# Setup

To start, we will need to set up this virtual repository as a local one to your computer. First, navigate to your desired location within the terminal:

```sh
cd ~/Desktop/your/desired/path
```

Next, you need to clone the repository to your own local computer. You can enter the following commands in the terminal to do so:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/acataldo29/robo-advisor
```

This will clone the repository and save it to the location you specified previously.
